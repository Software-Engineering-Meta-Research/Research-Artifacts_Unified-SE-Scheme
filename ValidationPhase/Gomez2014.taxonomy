Elements of an experimental configuration {
	Operationalization {
		Cause - Treatments,
		Effect - response variable
	},
	Population {
		Subject properties,
		Object properties
	},
	Protocol {
		Design,
		Experimental objects,
		Guides,
		Instruments,
		Analysis
		
	},
	Experimenter { /* Meta-Data */
		Designer,
		Trainer,
		Monitor,
		Measurer,
		Analyst		
	}
},

Types of Replications {
	Literal,
	Operational {
		Protocol, /* The experimental protocol elements are varied with the aim of verifying that the observed results are reproduced using equivalent experimental protocols */ 
		Operationalization, /*The cause and/or effect operationalizations are varied in order to verify the bounds of the cause and/or effect construct operationalizations within which the results hold */
		Population, /* The populations are varied to verify the limits of the populations used in the baseline experiment */
		Experimenter /* The experimenters are varied to verify their influence on the results */
	},
	 Conceptual /* Different experimenters run the replication with new protocol and operationalizations */
}
