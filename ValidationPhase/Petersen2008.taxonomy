Research Type Facet { /* by Wieringa et al. (Wieringa et al. 2006) */
	Validation Research, /* Techniques investigated are novel and have not yet been implemented in practice.
Techniques used are for example experiments, i.e., work done in the lab */
	Evaluation Research, /* Techniques are implemented in practice and an evaluation of the technique is conducted.
That means, it is shown how the technique is implemented in practice (solution implementation) and what are the consequences of the implementation in terms of benefits and drawbacks (implementation evaluation). 
This also includes to identify problems in industry. */
	Solution Research, /* A solution for a problem is proposed, the solution can be either novel or a significant extension of an existing technique. 
The potential benefits and the applicability of the solution is shown by a small example or a good line of argumentation. */
	Philosophical Papers, /* These papers sketch a new way of looking at existing things by structuring the field in form of a taxonomy or conceptual framework */
	Opinion Papers, /* These papers express the personal opinion of somebody whether a certain technique is good or bad, or how things should been done. 
They do not rely on related work and research methodologies. */
	Experience Papers /* Experience papers explain on what and how something has been done in practice. 
It has to be the personal experience of the author. */

Systematic Review Characteristics{
	Research Goals{
		Identify Best and Typical Practices, /*  analyzes a set of empirical studies to determine which techniques are used and work in practice. */
		Classification and Taxonomy, /* creates a framework or classifies the existing research */
		Emphasis on Topic Categories, /* means that the study identifies how much research is published in different sub-topics in the field of interest.  */
		Identify Publication Fora /*  identifies the journals, conferences and workshops relevant in the focus area. */
	},
	Inclusion Requirements {
		Research is Within Focus Area,
		Empirical Methods Used /*  included papers used empirical methods. */
	},
	Number of Included Articles {
		Potentially Relevant Studies, /* (i.e., found in the search) */
		Relevant Studies -Included /* (after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as quality checks) */
	},
	Means of Analysis{ /* Synthesis Methods */
		Meta Study, /* integrate several studies through statistical analyzes of the studiesï¿½ quantitative data */
		Comparative Analysis, /* uses logical simplification and confidence assessment theories. */
		Thematic Analysis, /*  counts papers related to specific themes or categories */
		Narrative Summary /* focus on qualitative review and narrative explanations. 
		 * Further means of analysis are described in (Dixon-Woods et al. 2005), but we have not found evidence of their use in software engineering systematic reviews. */
