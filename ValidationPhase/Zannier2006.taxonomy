Study Type{
	Controlled Experiment, /* All of the following exist: Random assignment of treatments to subjects. 
	 * Large sample size (>10 participants). 
	 * Hypotheses formulated. 
	 * Independent variable selected. 
	 * Random sampling. */
	Quasi Experiment, /* One or more of points in Controlled Experiment are missing */
	Case Study, /* All of the following exist: 
	 * Research question stated. 
	 * Propositions stated. 
	 * Unit(s) of analysis stated. 
	 * Logic linking the data to propositions stated. 
	 * Criteria for interpreting the findings provided. 
	 * Performed in a �real world� situation */
	Exploratory Case Study, /* One or more of points in Case Study are missing */
	Experience Report, /* All of the following exist: Retrospective. 
	 * No propositions (generally). 
	 * Does not necessarily answer how or why. 
	 * Often includes lessons learned */
	Meta-Analysis, /* Study incorporates results from previous similar studies in the analysis */
	Example Application, /* Authors describing an application and provide an example to assist in the description, but the example is "used to validate" or "evaluate" as far as the authors suggest */
	Survey, /* Structured or unstructured questions given to participants. */
	Discussion /* Provided some qualitative, textual, opinion-oriented evaluation. 
	 * E.g. compare and contrast, oral discussion of advantages and disadvantages. */

Sampling Type{
	Random{
		simple, /* Permits generalization from sample to the population it represents */
		stratified /* The population is divided into a number of parts according to some characteristic. Increases confidence in making generalizations to particular subgroups */
	},
	non-random{
		Convenience, /* Doing what is fast and convenient. On-the-spot decisions about sampling to take advantage of new opportunities during actual data collection */
		Self-selected, /* Respondents decide they would like to participate in the experiment/case study/survey */
		Investigator Selected, /* The investigator selects the sample */
		Quota, /* Population is segmented into sub-groups, like stratified sampling. 
		 * Then judgment is used to select the subjects or units from each segment based on a specified portion */
		Snowball, /* Identify cases of interest from sampling people who know people who know people who know what cases are information rich, that is, good examples for study. */
		Purposeful, /* Select information-rich cases strategically and purposeful; 
		 * specific type and number of cases selected depends on study purpose and resource */
		Critical Case /* Permits logical generalization and maximum application of information to other cases because if it's true of this one case, its likely to be true of all other cases */
	}	
},

Target and Used Population{ /* Question: does the target population match the used population*/
	yes,
	no
},

Evaluation Type{ /* who developed the subject under study and who evaluated it? */
	self-confirmatory,
	independent evaluation /* In an independent evaluation the authors evaluated a third party object. */
}
