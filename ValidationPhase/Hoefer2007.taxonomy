Method{ /* The empirical research method used for the study. We use categories from psychological research according to Christensen 
  		 * Empty categories are: Longitudinal and cross-sectional study, naturalistic observation.
 		 * Non-empty categories: case study, correlational study, ethnography, experiment, ex post facto study, meta analysis, phenomenology, survey*/
	Case study, /* In-depth analysis of a particular project, event, organization, etc. */
	Correlational study, /* Measuring variables and determining the degree of relationship that exists between them.*/
	Ethnography, /* Description and interpretation of the culture of a group of people.*/
	Ex post facto study, /* Study in which the variables of interest are not subject to direct manipulation, but must be chosen after the fact (e.g., when analyzing software repositories).*/
	Experiment Quantitative, /* study to test cause-and-effect relationships.*/
	Meta analysis, /* Integrates and/or describes the results of several studies.*/
	Phenomenology, /* Description of an individual�s or a group�s experience of a phenomenon.*/
	Survey /* Data is collected by interviewing a representative sample of some population*/
},

Source of Data{ /*  This characteristic categorizes the origin of the data used for empirical research  */
	Professionals, /* Data acquired from professionals directly by using them as subjects in an experiment or indirectly by collecting data from projects with professionals. */
	Students, /* Data acquired from students directly by using them as subjects in an experiment or indirectly by collecting data from a project with students.*/
	Both, /* Data acquired from students and professionals. */
	Benchmarks, /* Benchmarks are artificially composed data designed to measure the performance of a tool, method, algorithm, etc. */
	Software, /* The source Software refers to data derived from operational software (such as reliability data) irrespective of the methods of development for such software. */
	Studies, /* Data acquired from other studies (meta analysis). */
	Unknown /* Unstated source of data. Some articles do not state how the data was gathered or whether their subjects were students or professionals. */
