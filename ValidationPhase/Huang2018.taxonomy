Qualitative Synthesis Methods in Evidence Based Software Engineering EBSE{
	Narrative synthesis, /* Narrative description and ordering of primary evidence with commentary */
	Thematic synthesis, /* Identifying major or recurring themes in literature and summaries of results of primary studies under the headings of these themes */
	Meta-ethnography, /* �Interpretations and explanations in the primary studies are treated as data, and are translated across several studies to produce a synthesis� */
	Meta-summary, /* Quantitative oriented aggregation of qualitative findings. Identify the frequency of each discovery, as well as the discovery of high frequency findings */
	Content analysis, /* The evidence for each of the primary study is used under a wide range of thematic headings, designed to help with repetitive extraction tools */
	Grounded theory, /* Identifying patterns and relationships in primary data, sampling for analysis, exploring commonalities, and generating theories or models */
	Comparative analysis, /* Using Boolean logic (based on specific results of truth tables) to analyze complex causal relationships */
	Case survey /* Making closed questions to extract data and each primary study can be seen as a specific case */
