Types of SE Articles { /* Synonym: Article genres */
	Publishable papers in general, /* Summary:
	* Regular papers may be shaped as different genres, such as, for example, experimental papers, case studies, or surveys
	* A typical SE paper has a three-section structure: Introduction * Main Body * Conclusion
	* Appropriate style must be comprehensible
	* Relevance for practice, novelty, and originality are the most important requirements for publication
	*/
	Extended versions of conference papers, /* Summary:
	* Extended versions of conference papers are a typical genre of SE
	* Extended versions have passed through a double round of reviews
	* Many journals require that approximately one third of the content be new
	* Publication on a journal allows discussing the research beyond the time and space limitations set by conference
	*/
	Empirical research reports{ /* Summary:
	* Empirical research includes different research strategies such as case studies, experimental research, or qualitative research
	* Clear and comprehensive guidelines on how to write a proper empirical research paper are not yet available
	* The experimental context is considered important for all types of empirical research
	* Empirical research is increasing in SE
	*/
		Observational studies, /* Summary:
		* Observational studies include all empirical research strategies that impose little control over the developmental process
		* Contextual factors, such as the type of industry in which the products are used, or the experience and skills of software staff, affect the utility and generality of the results
		*/
		Case studies, /* Summary:
		* Case studies� most distinguishing feature is their descriptive character
		* It is difficult to distinguish case studies from experience reports or first-hand experience reports
		* The environment of the research is especially important to evaluate case studies
		* They allow for different data collection procedures, including controlled experiments
		* Their major advantage is that they reflect real world situations
		* Some authors argue that, for this reason, they can communicate better to practitioners
	 	*/
		Field studies, /* Summary:
		 * Neither the function of field studies nor their difference from case studies is clear in most sources 
		 */
		Experimental papers, /*
		* The terms ��experiment� and ��experimentation� are often used improperly in SE
		* Many researchers complain about the lack of standardization regarding collection measures for experimental research
		* Some also argue that current SE experimental research is insufficiently representative of industrial settings
		* It is particularly difficult to carry out true experimentation in SE real settings 
		*/
		Meta-analyses /*
		* Meta-analyses allow to combine results of various empirical studies
		* The lack of standardization in reports of empirical research makes it difficult to apply meta-analyses in SE 
		*/
	},
	Experience papers, /* Summary 
	* Experience reports are called by different names (��lessons learned reports�, ��industry experience reports�, etc.), and it is not clear if different names imply variations
	* Experience reports appear to be connected with application and practice
	* In some sources, practitioners are the expected authors of experience reports
	* Soundness of the report and objectivity are important publication requirements*/
	Theoretical papers, /* Summary 
	* Theoretical papers are often of a methodological or computational nature
	 i.e. they presenting computational methods and algorithms;
	* Relevance for practice is the most important requirement for publication */
	Tutorial articles, /* Summary 
	* Tutorials are mainly educational, and introduce the work done in a field in a highly comprehensible manner
	* Two types of tutorial are considered in the IEEE Software Guide: one focusing on applications and the other on research activities
	* Tutorials address audiences with different background and levels of experience */
	Surveys, /* 
	* Surveys complement tutorials, but address a more experienced audience
	* Surveys do not need to be novel, but should make a contribution to the understanding of an area
	* They help researchers as well as practitioners to keep up to date
	* They can have a role in bridging the gap between practice and researchSummary */
	Short papers, /* Summary 
	* Short papers deal usually with practical or technical topics
	* They usually undergo the same revision process as full-length papers
	* Negative results or repetitions of previous results fit well short papers */
	Papers oriented towards practice{ 
		Educational papers, /* Summary 
		* Educational papers appear more commonly in conferences than in journals */
	  	How to - tool report papers, /* Summary 
	  	* ��How to� and tool articles explain how to perform specific development tasks or on how to use specific tools
		* The conditions of applicability/inapplicability of the process or the tool at hand must be detailed */
		Application papers /* Summary 
		* Application papers are similar and related to experience reports, tool reports and ��how to� papers
		* They may focus on applications in different domains
		* They usually stress problems and obstacles to overcome */
	},
	Opinion papers /* Summary 
	* Opinion papers may cover general topics of interest for the field, comment on previously published papers, or explain a technical position
	* Requirements for publication include, among the others: convincing arguments, brevity, and interestingness */
